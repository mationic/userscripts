**Autopager for startpage.com**

Startpage uses subdomains to connect to their servers. GM_xmlhttpRequest is needed for cross-domain requests.
Working with POST requests for maximum privacy.

Current versions are stable for Chrome / Tampermonkey.
Greasemonkey had problems with GM_xmlhttpRequests sometimes in my tests.

New Design is supported. I recommend using a [https://userstyles.org/styles/93995/sgl-2-0](userstyle) to
enabling google look.
